        <h4>
          Tournament Specific rules: 
        </h4>
        <h5>
          <ul>
            <li> The game is a double elimination bracket for 16 (we have 13 teams) as described <a href="http://www.printyourbrackets.com/pdfbrackets/16teamdouble.pdf"> here </a>.
                Each team has to <strong> lose twice </strong> to get out of the competition. </li>
            <li> There will be no event when all games are played! The teams can <strong>decide on their own</strong> on when to play the games. 
            <li> All games will be played at the <strong> Mercator Common Room </strong> Foosball Table(this is the best table we have on campus). Except if the teams specifically agree to play on another table. </li>
            <li> The winner of a <strong>"match"</strong> is the team which gets to <strong>10 goals(or points) first</strong>. Also, you need a <strong>2 points difference</strong> to win. For example, if both teams have 9 points, each team has to score twice in a row(to have 11 points) to win. In more concrete terms: the match goes on until one team (the winner) has more or equal then 10 points and at least 2 points difference from the opponents score. </li>
            <li> The winner of a <strong>"game"</strong> is the team which wins </strong>two out of three matches</strong>. It is advisable to play the differenct matches on different sides of the table. </li>
            <li> After each game, the <strong>winner of the game</strong> has to submit the result of the game to <strong> d.hasegan@jacobs-university.de </strong>. Also, he/she has to put as <strong> cc </strong> the members of the losing team for confirmation. </li>
            <li> As shown in the bracket example <a href="http://www.printyourbrackets.com/pdfbrackets/16teamdouble.pdf">here</a>, the winner of the losers bracket has to win <strong> two games </strong> against the winner of the winners bracket in order to win the tournament.  </li>
            <li> In case some games take too long to complete and it breaks the flow of the tournament, I reserve the right to enforce deadlines for rounds. </li>
          </ul>
        </h5>

        <h4>
          Foosball Specific rules <small>(from <a href="http://www.foosballsoccer.com/official-foosball-rules.html"> here</a>) </small>: 
        </h4>
        <h5>
          <ul>
            <li> <strong> No Spinning </strong>  - A spin is a rule for when the rod completes a 360 degree rotation without touching the foosball. This is deemed an illegal move in the rules of foosball.</li>
            <li> <strong> No Jarring </strong> - Jarring is a rule for when a player slams his or her rods against the wall of the foosball table in an attempt to distract or jar the foosball loose from the other player's possession. The rule is that there is no jarring allowed at any point during a game. This is not the same as when a player on the opposite team moves his or her foosball rods back and forth in an attempt to play defense. The key this foosball rule is when a player hits the wall of the table with enough force to jar the ball or distract the opponent. That is why this is a subjective rule that may be called more strict by certain foosball player </li>
            <li> <strong> Dead Balls </strong> - If a foosball stops in the middle of two opposing team rods, the ball must be picked up and reserved. The serve goes back to the team that was last scored on. If a dead ball occurs on the defensive side of the table behind the defensive 2 bar, the defensive player must move the foosball back into playing position. This rule is in place so players don't cause a dead ball on purpose in order to force a reserve.  </li>
            <li> <strong> Out of Play </strong>  - If a ball comes off the table area or hits a top rail and comes back into the table area, the ball is ruled out of play and must be reserved by the team that was last scored on.  </li>
            <li> <strong> Flip A Coin </strong> - A coin flip decides who serves the foosball to start the foosball game. After the first goal is scored, the rule is that the team who was last scored on gets to serve the next ball. This rule keeps the foosball game fair for both opponents. The foosball must be touched by a foosball man before the ball goes into a goal for a legal goal to occur. </li>
          </ul>
